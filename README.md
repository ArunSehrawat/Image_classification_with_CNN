# Image classification with CNN and QNN

Image classification is a computer vision task, where a machine learning algorithm has to categorize images into predefined classes. Here, we have taken the "MNIST" and "FashionMNIST" datasets (for more details, see the attached notebooks).

The "MNIST" dataset contains images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

The "FashionMNIST" dataset covers ten different clothing categories, including T-shirts/tops, trousers, pullovers, dresses, coats, sandals, shirts, sneakers, bags, and ankle boots. Each image is labeled with the corresponding clothing category, providing the ground truth for training and testing.

**(2)** In another notebook, I have presented the **Quantum Neural Network (QNN)** for the task.

I have also uploaded:  
**(3) quantum circuit simulator** (used in QNN)

**(4)** a notebook with **quantum circuit examples** to test the quantum circuit simulator
