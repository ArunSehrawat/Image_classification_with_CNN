# Image classification with CNN

In the attached Jupyter notebook, I have presented the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification,
where the implementation is done using PyTorch. The CNNs are trained on the "MNIST" and "FashionMNIST" datasets (for more details, see the notebook)
